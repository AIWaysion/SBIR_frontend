Current solution:

Step 1: Get the RTSP stream

Step 2: Process each frame in the stream

Step 3: Transform the processed frame into a MJPEG stream

Step 4: Display the MJPEG stream on the browser

To run the code, type python process_stream.py and open 127.0.0.1:5000 in a browser. You should be able to see the processed stream.
